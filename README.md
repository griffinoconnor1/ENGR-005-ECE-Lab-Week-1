This code is to be used with a TI LaunchPad kit with MSP340 MCU, using TI Code Composer Studio Software.

When used with a MSP340 Microcontroller, pressing Button 1 (P4.1) will illuminate the red LED (P1.0), and pressing Button 2 (P2.3) will illuminate the green LED (P6.6).

Some definitions are listed at the top of the code to make the use of certain physical features of the board more understandable.
